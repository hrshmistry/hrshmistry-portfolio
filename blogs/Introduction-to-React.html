            <h1>Introduction to React</h1>
            <small>Jan, 2021 ðŸ•“ 2 min read</small>
            <p class="div-margin">What You Need to Know and Why It's Important!</p>

            <h2>Why React?</h2>
            <p>
                React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets
                you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components". <br><br>

                React simplifies web development for everyone. It is used by the majority of JavaScript developers for
                the past several years. Its large, active community continues to innovate and excite users.</p>

            <h2>Is React.js right for me?</h2>
            <p>Whether you are a software developer, business owner, student, or scientist, React could have a place in
                your career or business. Most businesses need a website, and many businesses need advanced features on
                their website. React can do it all, and much better than website technology of several years ago.</p>

            <h2>Do it all, easier and faster</h2>
            <p>With React you can not only build any website, you can do it with code that is easier to read, takes less
                time to implement, and takes advantage of countless community driven libraries. Previously, you would
                have to switch between HTML, JavaScript and CSS files for similar components on the page. React utilizes
                JSX, a smarter extension to JavaScript, to put HTML and CSS inside JavaScript. React Components are
                sharable pieces of JavaScript for any type of frontend UI element you can think of.</p>

            <p>While this may sound complicated, React is built around making things easy to use.</p>

            <h2>Who uses React?</h2>
            <p>React was created at Facebook and is used to drive the main websites of Twitter, AirBnB, Walmart and
                countless other companies. It's important that this isn't just a small part of these applications, the
                entire frontend application running in your web browser is now built with React. Industries everywhere
                are investing in React as a longterm solution to fulfilling their online goals.</p>

            <h2>What you need to know before React</h2>
            <p>There is some basic JavaScript you will need to know to start coding React apps. You may already be
                familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS, if not it is easy to get started. It's more often a small
                subset of these technologies that you need to learn, rather than learning them from front to back. You
                certainly don't need a degree in computer science to learn React.</p>

            <h2>Get started</h2>
            <p>If you're brand new to React, we recommend exploring with official <a
